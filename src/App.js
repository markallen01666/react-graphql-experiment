/* 
N.B. need to restructure code so that all the state functionality is handled in the App.js file while
Card.js concentrates on presentation and Picker.js handles selection of tool 
In App.js need to use useState() to setup a JS object for display fields on the 3 cards - e.g.

const [displaydata setdisplayData] = useState({
  card-1: {
    awareness: 0,
    interest: 0,
    satisfaction: 0,
    participants: 0
  },
  card-2: {
    awareness: 0,
    interest: 0,
    satisfaction: 0,
    participants: 0
  },
  card-3: {
    awareness: 0,
    interest: 0,
    satisfaction: 0,
    participants: 0
  }
});

The state values in the object will need to be passed to Card.js and displayed and changes to the selected tool
will have to be passed up to App.js to modify the state object when triggered by a Picker selection activating
the "toolChangedHandler" and displaying results[{props.id}].awareness ???

Need to also include values when "none" selected

Also - check out useReducer() as an alternative to useState to see if it works better with this problem

        The State of Javascript survey collected responses from over 22,000
        developers in 2019. Participants were asked a series of questions about
        different aspects of JavaScript, including front and back-end
        frameworks, ES6, mobile development, and testing.

        The final results are summarised in a report and changes from previous
        surveys analysed and visualised using a variety of tools.

        The State of JavaScript Survey is created and maintained by Sacha Greif
        (Design, writing, coding) and RaphaÃ«l Benitte (Data analysis, data
        visualizations). Through their website stateofjs.com the raw data is
        made available through a GraphQL API. This app uses GraphQL queries to
        access some of the results and summarises them.
